          COMPARISON OF THE PREDICTIVE VALUES 

Estimated positive PV of Test 1 is  88.07018 % and its standard error is 1.357669 

95 % confidence interval for the positive PV of Test 1 is ( 85.16952 % ;  90.49807 %) 

Estimated positive PV of Test 2 is  89.35484 % and its standard error is 1.238624 

95 % confidence interval for the positive PV of Test 2 is ( 86.69779 % ;  91.56234 %) 

Estimated negative PV of Test 1 is  64.78405 % and its standard error is 2.753091 

95 % confidence interval for the negative PV of Test 1 is ( 59.24617 % ;  69.97634 %) 

Estimated negative PV of Test 2 is  78.48606 % and its standard error is 2.593698 

95 % confidence interval for the negative PV of Test 2 is ( 73.02445 % ;  83.15112 %) 


Wald test statistic for the global hypothesis test H0: (PPV1 = PPV2 and NPV1 = NPV2) is  25.94449  

  Global p-value is  2e-06  

  Applying the global hypothesis test (to an alpha error of 5 %), we reject the hypothesis H0: (PPV1 = PPV2 and NPV1 = NPV2) 

  Estimated power (to an alpha error of 5 %) is 99.26 %  

  Investigation of the causes of significance: 

   Weighted generalized score statistic for H0: PPV1 = PPV2 is  0.807058  and the two-sided p-value is  0.368992  

   Weighted generalized score statistic for H0: NPV1 = NPV2 is  22.50225  and the two-sided p-value is  2e-06  

   Applying the Holm method (to an alpha error of 5 %), we do not reject the hypothesis H0: PPV1 = PPV2 and we reject the hypothesis H0: NPV1 = NPV2 

   Negative PV of Test 2 is significantly greater than negative PV of Test 1 

    95 % confidence interval for the difference NPV2 - NPV1 is ( 8.040664 % ;  19.36334 %)
